# DataExploration-in-SQL

The main objective of this project is to Explore the data using some SQL functions.
I started by dividing the original file into two csv files named CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations.
The following tasks were completed:
1.	Calculate the percentage of deaths on the total cases in each location/continent (Make use of Aggregate function and Group By)
2.	Using CAST/CONVERT functions to convert data type
3.	Performing table JOINS
4.	Make use of Window Functions to do a Rolling Count calculation
5.	Creating CTEs to further calculate values from the result table 
6.	Create a Temp Table as an alternative to a CTE
7.	Creating View to store data for later visualizations
